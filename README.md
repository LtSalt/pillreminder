# README

## TODO
- [ ] guard against double messages & entries
- [ ] send warning if not taken in the past cycle
- [ ] create action to trigger cycle pause manually


## Don't forget
- [ ] handle lingering messages 


## Also
- can't set global node version with `nvm.fish`
- maybe also nvm integration problem
- `bot` event listener and `tg` api in separate files. seems convoluted, might simplify
